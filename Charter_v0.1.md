> #### **2.** Premium Month-to-Month Subscription
> The monthly subscription would unlock:
> -  Scenario assessments based on real-world events. 
> -  AI insight to answers they got incorrect.  
>

MARKET AND CUSTOMER ANALYSIS

</bn>


## Market and Customer Analysis


### Business Case

The finance learning application will address four business needs, each justifying the initial investment of $108,000:

### Market Demand: 

The global personal finance education market was valued at $1.47 billion in 2024 and may reach $2.89 billion by 2033, according to Growthmarketreports, nearly doubling in size. Currently, US adults answer only about half (49%) of basic financial questions correctly, showing a significant knowledge gap.

### Social Need: 

A lack of financial knowledge costs Americans more than $246 billion each year, according to the National Financial Educators Council. Young people aged 18-29 scored the worst on financial literacy tests, answering only 38% of questions correctly, making them the most at-risk group.

### Customer Request: 

When young adults aged 18-24 were asked which high school course would help them most in life, over half (51.4%) said "money management," according to the National Financial Educators Council. Nearly half of all Americans (47%) rate their personal finance knowledge as a "C" or lower, according to WalletHub, suggesting an apparent demand for better education.
Technological Advance: The mobile financial education app market is growing rapidly at 24% per year and is expected to reach $1.5 billion by 2025, according to CUInsight. Applications and interactive learning provide better results than traditional textbooks or classroom lectures.

### Market Analysis

### Target Market: 

English-speaking young adults aged 18-28 who have recently started earning money but never learned about finances in school and want to begin investing.

### Market Size: 

In North America alone, the personal finance education market reached $520 million in 2024, according to Growthmarketreports. Young adults under 50 are much less likely than older adults to say they understand personal finances, according to the Pew Research Center, representing millions of potential users who need help.

Competitive Advantage: Our app will provide free education with an easy, complete step-by-step plan designed for total beginners, real-world practice scenarios, and focus solely on teaching without trying to sell investment products.
Customer Profiles

### Cost Analysis Summary
Year 1 has a budget of $108,000 ($60,000 startup costs, $48,000 yearly operating costs). We should be expecting 25,000 users in Year 1 with 5% buying premium features (1,250 subscribers at $10/month = $150,000) plus ad income ($2.50/user = $62,500) totaling $212,500 revenue, nearly doubling the investment. The cost to acquire each new user ($0.43) is much lower than typical app acquisition costs ($20-100).

RISK ANALYSIS AND MANAGEMENT

AUTHORED BY: EMILY KIM

</br>

## Risk Analysis and Management

This section outlines the major risks that could affect the successful completion of the financial education web application. It identifies threats related to schedule, budget, technical implementation, and compliance. It also includes assumptions, constraints, and mitigation strategies. The app is intended to be a free educational resource, with potential optional monetization features (ads or premium content) considered in the future.

### 1. Identification of Major Risks

#### Technical Risks
- **Scalability limitations:** Increased user traffic could degrade performance if backend services are not designed to scale.
- **Third-party service dependency:** Reliance on hosting and database services may cause downtime or unexpected failures.
- **Security vulnerabilities:** Weak authentication or encryption could expose user accounts or user-generated data.

#### Schedule Risks
- **Underestimated development effort:** Implementing core features such as login/signup, lessons, quizzes, vocab lists, analytics dashboards, and user profiles may take longer than anticipated.
- **Limited team availability:** Academic schedules or personal commitments may delay development milestones.

#### Budget Risks
- **Unexpected hosting or service costs:** Even free-tier hosting can incur costs if usage grows or resource limits are exceeded.
- **Optional monetization services:** Future implementation of ads or premium content may require additional setup or resources.

#### User Adoption Risks
- **Low engagement and retention:** Users may not consistently use the app if content is not engaging, lessons are too complex, or quizzes are not intuitive.
- **Target audience mismatch:** Content may not align with users’ financial literacy levels or learning goals.

#### Legal and Compliance Risks
- **Financial advice misinterpretation:** Users may interpret educational content as professional financial advice.
- **Data privacy issues:** Any stored user data (login info, progress tracking) must comply with privacy best practices and regulations.

### 2. Assumptions and Constraints

#### Assumptions
- Users will have access to reliable internet and modern web browsers.
- All content is strictly educational and not professional financial advice.
- Free-tier hosting and services will remain available and reliable.

#### Constraints
- Fixed development timeline: work begins February 18th.
- Limited team size and hours; all features must be prioritized realistically.
- Budget primarily limited to hosting and essential infrastructure costs. It must stay free.
- Development must focus on core functionality first (login/signup, lessons, quizzes, vocab list, analytics, profile).

### 3. Risk Reduction and Action Plan

#### Risk Reduction Strategies
- Implement secure authentication and encryption to protect user data.
- Break development into realistic milestones for each core feature, with buffer time for delays.
- Prioritize core educational features first.
- Optional features can be added after launch.
- Conduct usability testing to ensure lessons, quizzes, vocab lists, and analytics dashboards are effective and intuitive.
- Clearly display disclaimers stating the app provides educational content only.

#### Action Plan if Risks Are Realized
- Reduce scope by focusing on essential features if schedule or hosting limits are exceeded.
- Temporarily disable non-critical features to maintain project timeline.
- Iterate content or dashboards based on user feedback if engagement is low.
- Adjust privacy policies or disclaimers if compliance concerns arise.
